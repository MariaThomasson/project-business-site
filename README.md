# Business Site

This week we built a business site with a little touch of JavaScript. Focus on a Hero Image or Video, a Signup form, Accordion and the over all requirements:
- Style your page
- Site should have a header with responsive image/video
- Site should have a signup form with at least three different input types
- Site should have an FAQ accordion, built with JavaScript

I took advatage of my own company on this task and used a layout, video, font and some text. I knew this would help me focus more on the new learnings of JavaScript. 

For this week I added more comments and links in the code so you easily can find where I got the code, found some inspiration etc. Hopefully helpful for all.

## The problem

Well first of all: Hello JavaScript, could you BE anymore confusing!? Haha, I have struggled a bit, googled a lot and did a fair amount of time at Stack Overflow scrolling trough questions and answers. I will trust the process and hopefully it all will make sense. I found a lot of inspiration and help from former BootCamp-students, this years bunch of BootCamp-heroes and my Zebra-gang ;)
